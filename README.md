# Personalized-cancer-diagnosis
Problem statement : 
Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

Data Overview
We have two data files: one conatins the information about the genetic mutations and the other contains the clinical evidence (text) that human experts/pathologists use to classify the genetic mutations.
Both these data files are have a common column called ID
Data file's information:

training_variants (ID , Gene, Variations, Class)
training_text (ID, Text)

#Task
 Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
 
#Data
import the dataset from kaggle which link was provided in the data file
